I am planning a web app that will allow users to select interactive character cards for the science fiction card game, Helionox: The Last Sunset.  I will use the Bootstrap framework to design the site.  Users will be able to select one of roughly 12 character cards from a carousel, with each card having a text description beneath it.  Once selected, the user will be taken to an interactive 'card page' where they can utilize game-related features of the card, including adding and subracting tokens, tracking victory points, and reading more about their character's backstory.

The site will be designed with a mobile first approach, assuming that users will use character cards on their phones to track game-related actions as they play the physical, table top card game.  The site design will be simple and streamlined to allow for easy responsiveness.  

The site will include links to our compnay webpage, contact info, and a 'shop' page where users can add new cards to their collection.
